# Database-Security-with-Fingerprint-Masking

 Information in numerous areas including medication, business, and science was so crucial, in which directories are utilized efficiently for information sharing. Nevertheless, the directories confront the danger to be pirated, taken or even misused, which might lead to many of protection risks regarding ownership rights, information tampering as well as secrecy safeguards. Watermarking is the technology which is used to secure the database from the various attacks. It is also used to hide the content from the un authorized users. The majority of state-of-the- art techniques alter the initial information to a big level, lead to information quality wreckage, and then can't attain balance that is good between robustness from malicious strikes as well as information restoration. we suggest a reversible and robust watermarking method with Genetic Algorithm and Histogram Shifting Watermarking (GAHSW) to relation the numerical data. This algorithm used to get the unique key for the database as well as the watermarked place. Experimental evaluation show the usefulness and methods within the terminology of robustness from malicious strikes as well as upkeep of information quality. We have achieved the security level on comparing with existing system. Keywords:  Information Security, Watermark, Reversible, Right
